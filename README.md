# neuro_exam
2024 repository for the exam in Cognitive Neuroscience on the bachelor of Cognitive Science

## Purpose
The purpose of this exam is to do an analysis of the EEG data for the Faceword Experiment.
We will be working with the FaceWord behavioral dataset from the EEG workshop

At the moment we are talking about looking into emotional valence â€“ if EEG data helps observe emotional regonition between positive and negative

 - maybe looking into the N170?
Could also be looking into emotional priming
But the overall main interest is EMOTION.

And/or what will you focus on in the analysis?
Could be the N170 wave -> bigger amplitudes to emotional faces over neutral 

P3: Decision-making. Investigate whether there are differences in P3 amplitudes or latencies between conditions (positive vs. negative faces) and how these differences reflect the allocation of attentional resources or the engagement of cognitive processes associated with emotional evaluation.

Looking into the different amplitudes of the conditions.

## Deadline
10-06-2024

## Research Question Ideas
1. Does emotional processing/valence affect the N170 component during visual processing?
